OK Go set up over 1000 instruments over two miles of desert outside Los Angeles. A Chevy Sonic was outfitted with retractable pneumatic arms designed to play the instruments, and the band recorded this version of Needing/Getting, singing as they played the instrument array with the car. The video took 4 months of preparation and 4 days of shooting and recording. There are no ringers or stand-ins; Damian took stunt driving lessons. Each piano had the lowest octaves tuned to the same note so that they'd play the right note no matter where they were struck. Many thanks to Chevy for believing in and supporting such an insane and ambitious project, and to Gretsch for providing the guitars and amps.\n\nFor more information visit http://www.okgo.net. \n\nDirector: Brian L.

That's why the Producers made two separate scores, the 'Original Motion Picture Soundtrack' and 'The Album', where the 'OMPS' features the actual soundtrack and 'The Album' the well-known songs. Unfortunately, they only put 14 songs played on 'The Album', although there are 26 (+ 1 track only used in the Trailers) different songs in the movie! So we decided to unofficially extend 'The Album', featuring ALL 27 songs just for you. Enjoy!\n\n····\n\nPlease keep in mind that all content is shared with intent to accredit all parties involved.

Lukas is a very talented vocalist, and his music is some of my favorite out there.\n\nMy content is under fair use because YTPs are considered a mash-up/remix. Although I may use movies, TV shows, and music in my videos, I am using them in my own creative way to mold something new out of it.

Loved all through the world, IZ's version of \"Over the Rainbow\" has touched millions. \n\nWith each passing year, IZ’s presence in the music industry and the sales of his recordings continue to grow despite the trends that surround the industry. An amazing story about an amazing man, the man referred to by some as the “Hawaiian Suppaman”. While IZ has always been revered in Hawai‘i, his worldwide influence came later. IZ’s music first gained national attention in the mid 1990’s. Produced by Jon de Mello for The Mountain Apple Company • HAWAI`I \n\nLyrics:\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high\nAnd the dreams that you dream of\nOnce in a lullaby\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nBluebirds fly\nAnd the dreams that you dream of\nDreams really do come true\nSomeday, I wish upon a star\nWake up where the clouds are far behind me\nWhere trouble melts like lemon drops\nHigh above the chimney top\nThat's where you'll find me\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nBluebirds fly\nAnd the dreams that you dare to\nOh why, oh why can't I?\nWell, I see trees of green and red roses too\nI'll watch them bloom for me and you\nAnd I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\nWell, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white\nAnd the brightness of day\nI like the dark\nAnd I think to myself what a wonderful world\nThe colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky\nAnd also on the faces of people passing by\nI see friends shaking hands saying\nHow do you do?\nThey're really saying I, I love you\nI hear babies cry and I watch them grow\nThey'll learn much more then we'll know\nAnd I think to myself what a wonderful world\nWorld\nSomeday I wish upon a star\nWake up where the clouds are far behind me\nWhere trouble melts like lemon drops\nHigh above the chimney top\nThat's where you'll find me\nOh, somewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high\nAnd the dreams that you dare to\nWhy oh, why can't I?\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\n\nBUY THE SONG:\nOfficial Website: http://www.izhawaii.com\niTunes: https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/somewhere-over-the-rainbow-what-a-wonderful-world/id4940194?i=6920352&app=itunes&at=10ldBn\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Somewhere-Over-Rainbow-Wonderful-World/dp/B002Y4ADTI",

I found it hilarious cause it reminded me of the o'l YTPs. The first 21 seconds of audio from the meme aren't mine I just reused it and extended the meme of it for another 50 seconds or so.\n\nI original saw the meme from here: https://youtu.be/y4CIbwB2rbo\nand also here: https://youtu.be/GjjZacZSWT4\n\nIt seemed like a lot of people wanted a full or extended version so I decided to take it upon myself to add sort of a last entry to the jump in the caac mini meme. I just enjoyed it quite a lot and enjoyed making it too so here it is.\n\n(The likely last generations meme will come out a bit later when I have the times)",

Or was. One day, a woman entered the salon and left not too long after as a wail could be heard through out the beauty district. The next day the salon was shut down and Miss Value was nowhere to be found. \n\nMumu was on a supply run for organic machine synthesized sugar, they were running low after a successful bun-sale, when he bumped into someone. Flailing and screaming apologies he didn't notice that the lady he bumped into had a very familiar face.\n\n-----------------\nThe original sample sounds really close to Disney's Friend like me :OOO. If there's any typos or awkward sentenced pls halp.\n\nSample: Swing Dancing by Jean Veloz in Swing Fever\n\n-------------\n\n\nBandcamp\nhttps://simgretina.bandcamp.com/\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/simgretina\n\nSoundCloud/Download\nhttps://soundcloud.com/simgretina/peggy-suave-enemy-like-me\n\nTumblr\nhttp://simgretina.tumblr.com/",
