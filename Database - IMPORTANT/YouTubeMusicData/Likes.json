(3X)\nJump up, jump up and get down!\nJump! (17X)\nI'll serve your ass like John McEnroe\nIf your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe\nWord to your moms, I came to drop bombs\nI got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms\nAnd just like the Prodigal Son I've returned\nAnyone stepping to me you'll get burned\nCause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none\nIf you come to battle bring a shotgun!\nBut if you do you're a fool, cause I duel, to the death\nTrying to step to me, you'll take your last breath\nI got the skills, come get your fill\nCause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to Kill\nI came to get down, I came to get down\nSo get out your seat and jump around!\nJump around!

We started out with the original instrumental, and then formulated lyrics which we thought would be fitting. After we wrote lyrics, we went to recording. The song was recorded, and we went into FL Studio and we mixed our vocals. Mixing vocals for this video took around 5 days, roughly about 32 hours in total. After that, we mixed and sequenced everything and came up with the final product!",

(You could be glad)\nSunshine on the street at the parade\nBut you would rather be in the dark age\nJust makin' that sign must've taken all night\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace\nAnd control your urges to scream about the people you hate\n'Cause shade never made anybody less gay\n\n[Chorus]\nSo uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh\nYou need to calm down, you're being too loud\nAnd I'm just like uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh\nYou need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?\nYou need to calm down\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd we see you over there on the internet\nComparing all the girls who are killing it\nBut we figured you out\nWe all know now we all got crowns\nYou need to calm down\n\n[Chorus]\nUh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh\nYou need to calm down (You need to calm down)\nYou're being too loud (You're being too loud)\nAnd I'm like uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh\nYou need to just stop (Can you stop?)\nLike can you just not step on our gowns?\nYou need to calm down\n.........\n📷 Wallpaper: https://unsplash.com/\n.........\n\n📧Contact: monstafluffmusicnetwork@gmail.com\n.........\n#TaylorSwift #YouNeedToCalmDown #Lyrics",

Talk a look inside my brain\nThe people always different but it always feel the same\n\nThat’s the real me. Pop the champagne\nThe haters wanna hurt me and I’m laughin at the pain\n\nCHORUS\n\nStayin still, Eyes closed\nLet the world just pass me by\n\nPain pills, Nice clothes\nIf I fall I think I’ll fly\n\nTouch me, Midas\nMake me part of your design\n\nNone to guide us\nI feel fear for the very last time\n\n\nVERSE 2\n\nThey tell me that I’m special, I smile and shake my head\nI’ll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said\nThey tell me I’m so humble, I say I’m turning red\nThey let me lie to them and don’t feel like they’ve been misled\nThey give so much to me, I’m losing touch get me?\nServed on a silver platter, ask for seconds they just let me.\nThey tell me I’m a god, I’m lost in the facade\nSix feet off the ground at all times I think I’m feelin odd\nNo matter what I make, they never see mistakes\nMakin so much bread, I don’t care that they’re just being fake\nThey tell me they’re below me, I act like I’m above\nThe people blend together but I would be lost without their love\n\nPRE CHORUS\n\nCan you heal me? Have I gained too much?\nWhen you become untouchable you’re unable to touch\n\nIs there a real me? Pop the champagne\nIt hurts me just to think and I don’t do pain\n\nCHORUS \n\n\nStayin still, Eyes closed\nLet the world just pass me by\n\nPain pills, Nice clothes\nIf I fall I think I’ll fly\n\nTouch me, Midas\nMake me part of your design\n\nNone to guide us\nI feel fear for the very last time\n\nCHORUS 2\n\nLay still, Restless\nLosing sleep while I lose my mind\n\nAll thrill, No stress\nAll my muses left behind\n\nWorld is, below\nSo high up, I’m near divine\n\nLean in, Let go\nI feel fear for the very last time",

That would be \"Thunderstruck,\" the opening track on The Razors Edge. In addition to \"Thunderstruck,\" the band brought out \"Moneytalks,\" probably the closest they ever came to writing a pop song. Then there was \"Are You Ready\" - one of their fiercest calls to action. The gritty edge and booming chants on this album were a welcome reminder for a new generation that pure, unadulterated rock 'n' roll was alive and well.\n\nLyrics:\n[Intro]\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\nThunder, ah\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was caught\nIn the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)\nI looked 'round\nAnd I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)\nMy mind raced\nAnd I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)\nAnd I knew\nThere was no help, no help from you (Thunder)\nSound of the drums\nBeating in my heart\nThe thunder of guns\nTore me apart\n\n[Chorus]\nYou've been - thunderstruck\n\n[Verse 2]\nWent down the highway\nBroke the limit, we hit the town\nWent through to Texas\nYeah, Texas, and we had some fun\nWe met some girls\nSome dancers who gave a good time\nBroke all the rules, played all the fools\nYeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was shaking at the knees\nCould I come again please?\nYeah, the ladies were too kind\n\n[Chorus]\nYou've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck\nYeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck\nOh, thunderstruck\nYeah\n\n[Bridge 1]\nI was shaking at the knees\nCould I come again please?\nYow\n\n[Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nThunderstruck, thunderstruck\nYeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck\nThunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah\nSaid\n\n[Bridge 2]\nYeah, it's alright\nWe're doing fine\nYeah, it's alright\nWe're doing fine, so fine\n\n[Chorus]\nThunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah\nThunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck\nWhoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)\nYou've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck\nThunderstruck, thunderstruck\nYou've been thunderstruck\n\n#ACDC #Thunderstruck #TheRazorsEdge #Rock #HD #Remastered",

    "VideoDescription": "Hateno Village is one of those songs that stuck with me from Breath of the Wild, and I was completely stoked to hear it again in Tears of the Kingdom. It has such a chill vibe, similar to Kakariko Village, though with a little more mystique. It's just one of my absolute favorites from these two new Zelda games! Most of the percussion frames didn't make it into the video because there's so much going on in this song, but just imagine me slapping my cheeks in like three more frames x) Thanks to my buddy Zeisu for recording the dual game footage.\n\n● Support my videos on Patreon ► http://www.patreon.com/SmoothMcGroove\n\n● Listen to my music on Spotify ► https://goo.gl/idGtfK\n\n● Instagram ► https://www.instagram.com/smoothmcgroove/\n\n● Follow me on Facebook ► http://www.facebook.com/smoothmcgroove1\n\n● Follow me on Twitter ► http://twitter.com/SmoothMcGroove\n\n● Join my Discord server ► https://discord.gg/smooth",

OK Go set up over 1000 instruments over two miles of desert outside Los Angeles. A Chevy Sonic was outfitted with retractable pneumatic arms designed to play the instruments, and the band recorded this version of Needing/Getting, singing as they played the instrument array with the car. The video took 4 months of preparation and 4 days of shooting and recording. There are no ringers or stand-ins; Damian took stunt driving lessons. Each piano had the lowest octaves tuned to the same note so that they'd play the right note no matter where they were struck. Many thanks to Chevy for believing in and supporting such an insane and ambitious project, and to Gretsch for providing the guitars and amps.\n\nFor more information visit http://www.okgo.net. \n\nDirector: Brian L.

If you're susceptible to seizures, be careful, please.  Your viewing experience will look significantly better if you manually set your YouTube resolution settings to 1440p or 2160p (for desktop, click the gear icon in the lower right). Just leaving it on “Auto HD” results in some pretty intense distortion during a few sections, because when the the colors and patterns get crazy, there’s actually just too much information flying by for YouTube’s normal HD compression. We broke the matrix. The good people of YouTube have been working with us to solve this (it’s a bit rate limitation issue) over the last 24 hours, but there’s no quick fix, and now it’s Thanksgiving in the US, and we’re all with our families. \n\nWe hope you like it!

With her debut album Cry Baby, Melanie introduced the world to her distinctly original vision with hits like “Pity Party”, “Pacify Her”, “Alphabet Boy”, “Carousel” and “Sippy Cup”. Creating unique music videos for each album track, including “Soap/Training Wheels” and “Tag, You're It/Milk and Cookies”, Melanie portrays the traumas and insecurities of the album's titular character over a bed of electro pop, alternative and hip-hop. Her latest triumph K-12, an inspired new album and feature film directed by and starring Melanie, brings together a melting pot of low-key hip-hop, soulful pop and indie-leaning electro with whimsical, surreal visuals and magical realism to stunning results.\n\n#MelanieMartinez  #playdate #alternative #pop #crybaby",

Who would you die for?\nAnd would you ever kill?\n\nI’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,\nI’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.\nI’ve been thinking too much,\nHelp me.\n\nI’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,\nI’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.\n\nI’ve been thinking too much,\nHelp me.\n\n#TwentyOnePilots #Ride #Blurryface",

    "VideoDescription": "“Eat It” by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic - NOW IN 4K\nFollow \"Weird Al\" Yankovic on Spotify: http://smarturl.it/WeirdAlSpotify\n\nIn the new biopic WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story, there’s a scene where we see a clip of the “Eat It” video being played on a TV screen - except it’s actually a “deep fake,” with Al’s face replaced with Daniel Racliffe's (Dan, of course, plays Al in the movie).  In order to create that particular scene, the producers had to track down source material that was considerably better quality than the existing standard-definition version.  So Yankovic went into his personal video vault and had all the original 16mm film that was shot for the video in 1983 lovingly transferred to 4K.  Then, while traveling the country on his 2022 tour, he painstakingly re-edited the video on his laptop, matching the original video frame for frame.  The resulting video is not without scratches and artifacts (even in a temperature-controlled storage unit, film will start to degrade after a few decades) but it is exponentially better quality than any version that has ever existed before.\n \n“Eat It” is one of 46 tracks on the just-released WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story - Original Soundtrack album - you can stream, download or pre-order here: https://weirdalyankovic.lnk.to/WeirdTAYSYD\n \nWEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story is now streaming exclusively on The Roku Channel! Stream free on a Roku device, the Roku mobile app, therokuchannel.com, Samsung Smart TV & FireTV.\n\nLyrics:\nHow come you're always such a fussy young man?\nDon't want no Captain Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran\nWell, don't you know that other kids are starving in Japan?\nSo eat it, just eat it\nDon't wanna argue, I don't wanna debate\nDon't wanna hear about what kind of food you hate\nYou won't get no dessert 'till you clean off your plate\nSo eat it\nDon't you tell me you're full\nJust eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nGet yourself an egg and beat it\nHave some more chicken, have some more pie\nIt doesn't matter if it's broiled or fried\nJust eat it, eat it, just eat it, eat it\nJust eat it, eat it, just eat it, eat it, ooh\nYour table manners are a cryin' shame\nYou're playin' with your food, this ain't some kind of game\nNow, if you starve to death, you'll just have yourself to blame\nSo eat it, just eat it\nYou better listen, better do what you're told\nYou haven't even touched your tuna casserole\nYou better chow down or it's gonna get cold\nSo eat it\nI don't care if you're full\nJust eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nOpen up your mouth and feed it\nHave some more yogurt, have some more Spam\nIt doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned\nJust eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nDon't you make me repeat it\nHave a banana, have a whole bunch\nIt doesn't matter what you had for lunch\nJust eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nEat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nEat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nIf it's gettin' cold, reheat it\nHave a big dinner, have a light snack\nIf you don't like it, you can't send it back\nJust eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nGet yourself an egg and beat it\n(Oh Lord)\nHave some more chicken, have some more pie\nIt doesn't matter if it's broiled or fried\nJust eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it\nDon't you make me repeat it\n(Oh no)\nHave a banana, have a whole bunch\nIt doesn't matter what you had for lunch\n\n#WeirdAlYankovic #OfficialMusicVideo #Parody #4KRemastered",

Only time\n\nEnya was born Eithne Ni Bhraonain in Donegal, Ireland. Enya studied classical music at college under private tuition. On leaving college she was asked by Producer Nicky Ryan to join her siblings in their family band. She did so for a short time, but found it too restrictive musically, and so in 1982 she joined Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan in a creative and business partnership. Enya's first commission was to write a score for Sir David Puttnam for his film \"The Frog Prince\". Then, the triumvirate secured the soundtrack to the BBC documentary series 'The Celts'. Enya was then signed by Warner Music and all three by EMI Music Publishing. The first album of this contract was \"Watermark\" with the hit single \"Orinoco Flow\". This was followed by \"Shepherd Moons\", \"The Memory of Trees\", \"Paint the Sky With Stars\", \"A Day Without Rain\" which produced the single, \"Only Time\".\n\n#Enya #OnlyTime #4K #Remastered",

The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records.

BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n#ColdplayXBTS #MyUniverse #Coldplay #BTS #MusicOfTheSpheres",

Absolutely, it even has to be. At least when the French alternative-pop-folk superstars Nili Hadida and Benjamin Cotto, alias Lilly Wood & The Prick, have their way. Their haunting melody \"Prayer in C\" was quickly snatched up by the DJ, producer and label owner Robin Schulz from Osnabruck, Germany, and sublimated into a shining dancefloor pearl!\n\nAt the beginning of this year the head of Lausbuben Records (\"Rascal\" Records) and star DJ Robin Schulz already entered the Top 40 of the German iTunes charts with his single \"Sunset\". Last March he shoved none less than Pharrell Williams from the charts throne with his \"Waves\" remix for the Dutch rapper Mr. Probz and took a cosy position at Number One in the German singles, iTunes, airplay and dance hitparade charts. But this is not all because Robin Schulz is more than successful on an international level.  The \"Waves\" remix stayed at #24 in the global iTunes Single Charts, at #21 in the global Spotify Charts and has held a Top 10 position in the Beatport Charts for more than three months. Following acclaimed live appearances in Germany, Holland, France and the UK, the Soundcloud-plays millionaire reached into his electronic bag of tricks and delivers a preview for the upcoming summer holidays with his deep house style remix of Lilly Wood & The Prick's \"Prayer in C\".\n\nIt's a superstar collaboration: \"Prayer in C\" is the acoustic counterpart to an open air summer party night in the Provence: the scent of lavender in the air and an atmosphere somewhere between melancholy and euphoria. The track is driven by the absolutely captivating, goose-bump-inducing voice of Nili Hadidas, who with her sexy-smoky timbre, the haunting lyrics as well as Benjamin Cotto's wistful acoustic guitar melody create the organic vibe. The Robin Schulz remix underlays the track with a tight straight-on beat that transforms the original folk-pop track into an energic. melody-house club hymn. And Schulz must know how to do it: nearly 113,000 Soundcloud followers, who clicked his tracks several million times altogether, can't be wrong (for example, \"Willst Du\" has more than 1.2 million clicks or \"Sunset\" more than 820,000). And also his YouTube videos for his bootlegs with millions of clicks show that Robin Schulz knows how to seize the latest sound and serve it up to the masses in a sizzling new package. At the moment Robin Schulz is experiencing the hottest clubs in Europe on an extending tour. And the original creators of the track, the Paris duo Lilly Wood & The Prick don't have to play themselves down as far as fame is concerned. At home in France, the duo advanced to genuine superstars following their double-platinum debut abum. At the beginning of the year, one album track, \"Into Trouble\" was used in a TV spot for the noble jewelry brand Cartier. Together with Robin Schulz they deliver the next club diamond with \"Prayer in C (Robin Schulz Remix)\".\n\nDirector: Maxim Rosenbauer\nDoP: Dimitri Hempel\nProducer: Jana Ehrpunkt\nEditor: Kolja Frase\nThe Dog: Don\nAn EASYdoesit Production",

Now, the Osnabrück-native, superstar DJ and producer is set to release his highly-anticipated follow-up longplayer: Almost exactly one year after the release of his globally acclaimed breakthrough debut, Schulz is back on track with yet another stroke of genius: Promisingly entitled “SUGAR”, album no. 2 will be released later this year on September 18th!\n\nEarlier this July, Schulz was awarded Triple Gold for his tremendous hit single “Prayer in C”, Platinum for “Sun Goes Down (feat. Jasmine Thompson)” as well as Gold for his debut album “Prayer” in his home territory – just 3 on a list of over 60(!) awards already amassed by the German deep house shooting star. In light of his upcoming new longplayer “SUGAR”, Robin Schulz is now about to take the next step in his amazingly successful career:\n\nAfter his airplay #1 and global smash single “Headlights” (feat. Ilsey) which delivered the first taste of his new album’s sound, the twentysomething is set to release the eponymous second single on July 17th: “Sugar”, featuring 19-year-old Canadian singer Francesco Yates. Yates is widely considered the next big popstar in the making and his soulful falsetto vocals are quickly gaining praise by superstars such as Pharrell Williams or Justin Bieber. \n\nThat being said, Schulz is more than likely to build on his peerless, record-breaking achievements of the past 18 months: Last year’s mega hit “Prayer in C” landed Robin Schulz the #1 spot on iTunes in 40 countries and topped the national singles charts in 17 countries, but that was just the beginning. His #1 remix of “Waves” earned him a Grammy nomination, while his Top 7 album “Prayer” received the German ECHO award for best “Dance National”, in addition to a completely sold-out US tour. \n\nToday, Schulz remains the first German artist to attain the #1 spot in the global Shazam charts. He runs the most successful German YouTube music channel with a combined 330 million views, while generating downloads and streams in excess of nine figures. \n\nOn the heels of his recent tour of the U.S., Canada, South Africa and Australia, Robin Schulz will be headlining major electro & dance festivals all over the world throughout the summer, such as Belgium’s Tomorrowland Festival.\n\nhttp://www.warnermusic.de\nhttp://www.youtube.com/warnermusicDE",

Puth has amassed eight multi-platinum singles, four GRAMMY nominations, three Billboard Music Awards, a Critic’s Choice Award, and a Golden Globe nomination. His 2018 GRAMMY-nominated LP, Voicenotes, was RIAA Certified Gold only four days after its release and has logged over 6 billion streams worldwide. Puth’s 2020 collaboration with Gabby Barrett on their “I Hope” Remix earned him his fourth top 10 track on the Billboard Hot 100, hit number one on the Billboard “Adult Pop Songs” chart, and won a 2021 Billboard Music Award for “Top Collaboration.” Puth also co-wrote and produced The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber’s record-breaking single, “Stay,” which quickly become one of the biggest songs of 2021 and holds the title for the longest-reigning No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart and the first to lead it for double-digits - spending a total of eleven weeks at the top of the chart.\n\nThe official YouTube channel of Atlantic Records artist Charlie Puth.

(Requests)\nI love requests; some of the best videos have come from your requests! However, I get a lot of requests, so I try not to make any promises about what I will and won't cover. When choosing what music to cover I look for popularity, relevance and, ultimately, whether I like the music and believe I can do it any justice.\n\nAny tips for people wanting to pick up keyboard/ piano?\n1. Listen to as much music as possible!\n2. Learn to play by ear. Listen to the music you like and try to figure out how to play through trial and error. You can use sheets to see if you got it right, if you like.\n3. Learn the major, minor and pentatonic scales, as well as basic chords. These will help you to…\n4. IMPROVISE. Have fun and make stuff up. There’s plenty of teachers on YouTube who can give you great advice on how it's done.\n5. Use the internet. This was a huge part of my own development as a player. I am almost completely self-taught… unless you count the internet as a teacher!\n\nWhat equipment do you use?\nFor A-Bit of 8-Bit I play a Novation Launchkey 49. I run this through Plogue Chipsounds for the 8-bit sounds. I record and arrange in FLstudio. I use a Canon Kiss x4 to film and edit in Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nFor Piano Joe I play a Bernstien Upright Piano (used as a MIDI device) using the plugin: Alicia's Keys. I film with GoPro hero4 and edit in Adobe Premiere Pro.",

Doing what we do, it’s entirely all about the fans.  We walk a fine line by being “famous” and in the public eye but we are only here because of you, the fans.  Justin wrote this record during a tough time in his life and it comes to us that sometimes, as artists, we are also just objects and we have to take that as much as we have to use that to create.

Lukas is a very talented vocalist, and his music is some of my favorite out there.\n\nMy content is under fair use because YTPs are considered a mash-up/remix.

I was super into PC gaming at that point, and my only exposure to the handheld was from a room mate and a few kids that my mom would watch sometimes. Fast forward to about two months ago, where I go on a bit of a DS-games-I-never-played binge. This was one of the games I picked up, and it's just great! A classic, with an amazing classic Mario soundtrack!

I've been sitting on this arrangement since last year, so it's good to finally record it!\n\nMegalovania was the first song I heard from Undertale.  I vividly remember someone sending me this song as a request and curiously opening up the link.  \"Wow, this is good music for an indie game!\" I thought.  I listened to more music, and kept thinking the same thing.  I read a little about how the creator (Toby) took inspiration from Touhou and Earthbound, which got me to download and play the game.  After playing it, aside from all the hype, I can say that I haven't had this much fun playing an RPG (or a game, really) for a long time.  Such a unique breath of fresh air.  I hope you guys enjoy my musical tributes to this game!\n\n●Support me on Patreon ► http://www.patreon.com/SmoothMcGroove\n\n●Join my Discord server ► https://discord.gg/0qszWYeoeYBNXpHX\n\n●Download my albums on iTunes: http://bit.ly/1rTxp0a\n\n●Download my music on Bandcamp: http://smoothmcgroove.bandcamp.com/\n\n●Smooth McGroove on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/smoothmcgroove1\n\n●Smooth McGroove on Twitter: http://twitter.com/SmoothMcGroove\n\n언더테일",

I love the soundtrack to this game (and the sequel), but epic orchestral songs intimidate me because they already sound sooooo good.  I'm like, \"what's the point? why make a cover? it already sounds epic...\".  Since I've been gone so long, I got brave and did it anyways.  Hope you guys enjoy! ⭐\n\nP.S: I used to put on the Mario Galaxy soundtracks in my living room, then go into my recording room, close the door and start working on music.  I could barely hear it at that point, but it still got me pumped to work on music :D\n\nCatch me live on Twitch! ► https://www.twitch.tv/smoothmcgroove\n\n●Support my videos on Patreon ► http://www.patreon.com/SmoothMcGroove\n\n●Listen to my music on Spotify ► https://goo.gl/cS6ZDv\n\n●Download my music on iTunes ► https://goo.gl/X9UbDY\n\n●Download my music on Google Play ► https://goo.gl/Ymdr7z\n\n●Follow me on Facebook ► http://www.facebook.com/smoothmcgroove1\n\n●Follow me on Twitter ► http://twitter.com/SmoothMcGroove\n\n●Join my Discord server ► https://discord.gg/0qszWYeoeYBNXpHX",

It was one of the first songs I remember really liking from the game.  It's the perfect song to play during the first major boss battle in which your decisions make a big difference in the game...and your emotions.\n\nThe crazy bass line to this song required doing two separate bass tracks, layering them together.  Not sure I've ever had to do that before!  As usual, I left out a few instruments from the video to keep it looking nice  :-]\n\n●Support me on Patreon ► http://www.patreon.com/SmoothMcGroove\n●Download my albums in high-quality on Loudr.fm: https://loudr.fm/artist/smooth-mcgroove/YaszY\n●Download my albums on iTunes: http://bit.ly/1rTxp0a\n●Download my music on Bandcamp: http://smoothmcgroove.bandcamp.com/\n●Smooth McGroove on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/smoothmcgroove1\n●Smooth McGroove on Twitter: http://twitter.com/SmoothMcGroove\n●Join my Discord server ► https://discord.gg/0qszWYeoeYBNXpHX\n\n언더테일 (Undertale)",

So many rainbowey thingies in the midi o.o\n\nRainbow Tylenol is the song used in Rainbow Trololol, so I used the two song names interchangeably. \n\nPlease subscribe for more remixes! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gingeas?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSoundFont: Z-Doc's Yamaha Grand (his personalized grand piano that is not public).\nSoundFont made by Z-Doc R./ZDocPianoPlayer/Zarhym Raider\nAuthor Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/ZDocPianoPlayer\n\nI accept contact by email (see my channel's about tab), Discord (below), and YouTube message. Any of these three methods will certainly guarantee a response from me.

If you uploaded your video after this, then it likely won't be found by me (and/or I won't remember). Also, if your video is not reachable with a simple search, that is likely why as well. If you really want it on the list, contact me.\n\nMost of my videos are edited for no lag -- nobody wants to listen to 10 hours of lag. \n\nA very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer screen, or while playing videos such as this, may induce an epileptic seizure in these individuals. If you, or anyone in your family, have an epileptic condition, consult your physician prior to watching this video.\n#blackmidi\n#impossibleremix\n#synthesia",

    "VideoDescription": "”It’s so far away from anything I’ve ever done before musically, so it’s obviously a weight off my shoulders that everything went the way it did” — Tim ’Avicii’ Bergling.\n \nJune 17th 2023 marks one decade since the release of Wake Me Up – a song that came to change EDM music forever. As a key part of the album True, Wake Me Up was one of the songs where Avicii showed the world his ability to blend different genres — transcending the boundaries of ages, music preferences, and cultures worldwide.\n\nIn loving memory of Tim Bergling (1989-2018).\n\nListen to more music by Avicii here: https://Avicii.lnk.to/Channel\nIn Dolby Atmos: https://avicii.lnk.to/SpatialAudio\n\nFeeling my way through the darkness\nGuided by a beating heart\nI can't tell where the journey will end\nBut I know where to start\nThey tell me I'm too young to understand\nThey say I'm caught up in a dream\nWell life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes\nWell that's fine by me\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nDidn't know I was lost\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nDidn't know I was lost\nI tried carrying the weight of the world\nBut I only have two hands\nHope I get the chance to travel the world\nBut I don't have any plans\nWish that I could stay forever this young\nNot afraid to close my eyes\nLife's a game made for everyone\nAnd love is a prize\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nDidn't know I was lost\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself, and I\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know\n\n#Avicii #WakeMeUp",

At the Disco released its debut studio album ‘A Fever You Can't Sweat Out’ in 2005, which became certified double platinum in the US. Following in 2008, the band's album ‘Pretty. Odd.’ marked a significant departure from the band’s debut sound. 2011 brought the band’s 3rd album ‘Vices & Virtues’, which featured “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” and spent 10 consecutive weeks on the iTunes “Top Alternative Songs” chart. In 2013, the band released the album ‘Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!’, featuring “This Is Gospel”. Panic’s 2016 album ‘Death of a Bachelor’ spawned hits like the gold certified track \"Hallelujah”. Most recently, the band released \"Say Amen (Saturday Night)\", the lead single from the 2018 studio album ‘Pray for the Wicked’.\n\n#PanicAtTheDisco #HighHopes #PrayForTheWicked #OfficialAudio #PATD #FueledByRamen",

Please credit me in your description. I had to deal with too many thieves & false claims, so to protect my work, you might get a pre-emptive claim from my friends at State51. If you wish to monetize on YT, or would like to purchase a commercial license, please reach out via email. \n\nAlso. Backstory of the song: during the 2019 contest hosted by Discord, people were making all sorts of cool fanart and bots. There was even a Music category, which is the one I wanted to compete in. The prize was literally just 1 year of nitro and some merch, so nobody else really took it as seriously, but I saw an opportunity and I went all out. Since we only had 4 days to make something, I was in a hurry. You can tell because of wacky decisions like the fact that the BPM of the song is 142.86 (lmao). I remember wanting the discord ping sound effect to sync perfectly with the grid. Unfortunately I didn't even end up winning the prize, but it still paid off to put in the work! I got blessed by the youtube algorithm a few months later, and now I have my dream music career. Thank you all ^^\n\nAlso! Ping 2 dropped: https://youtu.be/8CYy9jNmpXM \n\n#exyl #discord",

    "VideoDescription": "The official music video for \"Grenade\" by Bruno Mars from the album 'Doo-Wops and Hooligans'.\n\nDirected by Nabil\n\n\"Today, I get to share with you the visual companion piece to my new single, 'Grenade.' The song is about loving someone so deeply, and the pain of knowing that the person you love does not feel the same. The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate.\" -- Bruno Mars\n\n🔔 Subscribe for the latest official music videos, live performances, lyric videos, official audio, and more ➤ https://Atlantic.lnk.to/BMsubscribe\n\nWatch All Of Bruno Mars’ Official Music Videos ➤ https://bit.ly/2U7I3mi\n\nSee Bruno Mars on tour ➤ Visit http://brunomars.com/tour for dates and more info.\n\nGet Bruno Mars merchandise ➤ https://brunom.rs/brunomarsstore\n\nFollow Bruno Mars:\nhttp://www.brunomars.com\nhttp://www.instagram.com/brunomars\nhttp://www.twitter.com/brunomars\nhttp://www.facebook.com/brunomars\n\nLYRICS\nEasy come, easy go, that's just how you live\nOh, take, take, take it all but you never give\nShould've known you was trouble from the first kiss\nHad your eyes wide open, why were they open?\n\nGave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash\nYou tossed it in the trash, you did\nTo give me all your love is all I ever asked\n'Cause what you don't understand is\n\nI'd catch a grenade for ya\nThrow my hand on a blade for ya\nI'd jump in front of a train for ya\nYou know I'd do anything for ya\n\nI would go through all this pain\nTake a bullet straight through my brain\nYes, I would die for you, baby\nBut you won't do the same\n\nNo, no, no, no\n\nBlack, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb\nTell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from\nMad women, bad women, that's just what you are, yeah\nYou'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car\n\nGave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash\nYou tossed it in the trash, yes, you did\nTo give me all your love is all I ever asked\n'Cause what you don't understand is\n\nI'd catch a grenade for ya\nThrow my hand on a blade for ya\nI'd jump in front of a train for ya\nYou know I'd do anything for ya\n\nI would go through all this pain\nTake a bullet straight through my brain\nYes, I would die for ya, baby\nBut you won't do the same\n\nIf my body was on fire\nOoh, you'd watch me burn down in flames\nYou said you loved me, you're a liar\n'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby\n\nBut darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya\nThrow my hand on a blade for ya\nI'd jump in front of a train for ya\nYou know I'd do anything for ya\n\nI would go through all this pain\nTake a bullet straight through my brain\nYes, I would die for you, baby\nBut you won't do the same\n\nNo, you won't do the same\nYou wouldn't do the same\nOoh, you never do the same\nNo, no, no, no\n\nThe official YouTube channel of Atlantic Records artist Bruno Mars. \n \n11x GRAMMY Award winner and 27x GRAMMY Award nominee Bruno Mars is a celebrated singer, songwriter, producer, and musician with iconic hits like \"The Lazy Song\", \"That's What I Like\", \"Just The Way You Are\", \"24K Magic\", \"Locked Out Of Heaven\", and \"When I Was Your Man\".

Say so\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches there to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused, you want it? Say so\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's been a long time since you fell in love\nYou ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself\nTell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)\n'Cause luckily I'm good at reading\nI wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'\nAnd we can dance all day around it\nIf you frontin', I'll be bouncing\nIf you want it, scream it, shout it, babe\nBefore I leave you dry\n\n[Chorus]\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches there to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused, you want it? Say so\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches there to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused, you want it? Say so (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)\nHe ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)\nHe ain't ever even been impressed like this\nProlly why I got him quiet on the set like zip\nLike it, love it, need it, bad\nTake it, own it, steal it, fast\nBoy, stop playing, grab my ass\nWhy you actin' like you shy?\nShut it, save it, keep it pushin'\nWhy you beating 'round the bush?\nKnowin' you want all this woman\nNever knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)\nAll of them bitches hating I have you with me\nAll of my niggas sayin' you mad committed\nRealer than anybody you had, and pretty\nAll of the body-ody, the ass and titties\n\n[Chorus]\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches there to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused, you want it? Say so\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches there to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused, you want it?

The next day the salon was shut down and Miss Value was nowhere to be found. \n\nMumu was on a supply run for organic machine synthesized sugar, they were running low after a successful bun-sale, when he bumped into someone. Flailing and screaming apologies he didn't notice that the lady he bumped into had a very familiar face.\n\n-----------------\nThe original sample sounds really close to Disney's Friend like me :OOO.

    "VideoDescription": "Macklemore & Ryan Lewis present the official music video for Can't Hold Us feat. Ray Dalton. \n\nCan't Hold Us on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cant-hold-us-feat.-ray-dalton/id560097651?i=560097694\nThe Heist CD deluxe edition: http://www.macklemoremerch.com\nThe Heist digital deluxe on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-heist-deluxe-edition/id560097651\nThe Heist on Amazon: http://amzn.com/B00908DDZM\nThe Heist in-stores NOW!\n\nNote from Ryan Lewis:\n\nIt seems like when a music video comes out, the title that receives all of the credit and travels with a film is that of the director. It's as though the director is the \"artist\" or \"creator\" of the music video, when in reality a music video is first a written treatment, produced (putting together ingredients like actors and locations), shot and directed, cut on the editing board and finally color graded. The music might be fine tuned and scored specifically for that film. There are so many variables that are completely equal if not sometimes more complicated than directing, it's a shame that so much credit comes down to whoever fulfills that position. A director wouldn't have shit to direct without a producer. A producer would have nothing to produce without a writer, and so forth. \n\nFor our team, I think it's even more complicated because roles tend to cross over. We simply don't work within the conventional hierarchy of the film industry (director, producer, etc.) Sure, people have concrete pre-defined roles based on their expertise, but our team has the remarkable ability to wear multiple hats. Can't Hold Us was a video that showcased this well. \n\nAfter three months of shooting, finally getting to those last few frames where you reveal the credits, it's a tense moment. There isn't exactly a sensible way to do it, if we're trying to fit people into classic film roles. It leads me to the point that although we do our best to give people titles, this was a video fully created by seven individuals at the forefront. Take any of those people out of the equation, you'd be watching a very different video. I write this in hopes that you don't fall under the illusion that one person creates a music video, particularly at the Macklemore camp.
